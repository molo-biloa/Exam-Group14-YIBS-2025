# Exam-Group14-YIBS-2025
This repository contains scripts for training an AI model on datasets like Fashion-MNIST. The project covers data preprocessing, model training, and saving the trained model for inference.

## **Part 1: Model Training on Google Colab**  

### **Step 1: Access Model Training Code**  
1. Go to the [`model` folder](https://github.com/molo-biloa/Exam-Group14-YIBS-2025/tree/main/model) in our repository
2. Open [ `Exam_Group14_YIBS_2025.ipynb`](https://github.com/molo-biloa/Exam-Group14-YIBS-2025/blob/main/Exam_Group14_YIBS_2025.ipynb) 
3. Click the "Open in Colab" button (top-right) 

### **Step 2: Run in Google Colab**  
1. Once opened in Colab, connect to a GPU runtime:
   - `Runtime > Change runtime type > GPU`
2. Run all cells sequentially (`Runtime > Run all`)
3. The notebook will:
   - Install dependencies
   - Download dataset
   - Train model
   - Save `fashion_mnist_cnn_v2.pth`
   - Generate training metrics
   -Generate Loss graph

### **Step 3: Download Trained Model**  
After training completes:
1. Check files panel (left sidebar)
2. Right-click `fashion_mnist_cnn_v2.pth`
3. Select "Download"
